<p> If your state is currently under quarantine, or as at risk of going into one, here are some tips to handle the situation! </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Keep a Routine- With staying home, it becomes difficult to maintain a structured sleeping, work, and recreational schedule. Try to keep up with the same structure you had before quarantine. <br>
        </li>
 
        <li>
            Stay connected! Some people might be living alone, while others are living with family or friends. Either way, it can be a difficult time for everyone. If you're living alone, be sure to call people daily. Video chatting while cooking, or watching movies together VIA Netfllix Party could help. If you're living with others, being stuck inside with them for long periods of time may lead to some confrontation- so be sure to set some time for yourself.
            <br>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Stay physical! If you're used to going to the gym everyday, don't stress, there are plenty of homework out videos online to help you stay fit. However, if you're not an active gym attendee, it is important for you to stay physical while in quarantine as well. You body is used to be out and about, but if you're home all the time, you lose that activity, so be sure not to lounge around too much!
             <br>
        </li>
       
        <li>
        Take a break from technology! Step away from your computers and televisions. Make something new, have a one-man dance party.
                 <br>
        </li>
   
        <li>
        Maintain a positive additude! This situation is not forever, and you're strong enough to get through it. Keep pushing through.
        </li>
     
    </ol>
