<p id="p2"> “I wish that patients knew that they can be asymptomatic and can still have it and spread it. I wish they knew that social distancing was more about slowing the spread in the community than it is about getting exposed and contracting it yourself.” - Dr. Matt Coward, a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons
    <br>
    <br>
    “By our most conservative estimate, at least 59% of the infected individuals were out and about, without being tested and potentially infecting others. This may explain why the virus spread so quickly in Hubei and is now circulating around the world.”

– Prof. Wu Tangchun

    “I wish my patients knew that coronavirus is not just a “bad flu.” It is a major respiratory infection that can cause detrimental health effects on people of all ages... people need to practice social distancing and stay home. That is how we are going to get a handle on this virus.” - Dr. Alana Biggers
